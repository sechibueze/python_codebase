# what is a Variable?

# Declare and use a Variable
from tkinter import Variable


name = "Samuel"
age = 23
print(name)
print(age)

# Over-riding varibales
age = 2
print(age)

# Rules for naming variables
# - The first character of a varibale name must be either letter or underscore
# - The only special character allowed in a varible name is underscore
# - Python keywords cannot be used as variable name. Example: print, for, not, is, while, def
# Varible names are case-sensitive ie: firstname is not same as firstName

first_name = ""
_counter = 0
lastName = 0
# Recommended practice for naming variables @PEP guide

# Varible naming convention
# - Camel casing
# - Snake casing
# - pascal case
