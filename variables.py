# Introduction to Variables
# what is a Variable?
# Declare and use a Variable
# Variable naming conventions

# Varibales are used to store data
name = "Samuel"
age = 23
is_hungry = False
price = 99.07
print(name)
print(age)
# TODO - display the value of the other two variable


# Over-riding varibales
age = 32
print(age)

# Rules for naming variables
# - The first character of a varibale name must be either letter or underscore
# - The only special character allowed in a varible name is underscore
# - Python keywords cannot be used as variable name. Example: print, for, not, is, while, def
# Varible names are case-sensitive ie: firstname is not same as firstName

first_name = "Kingsley"
_counter = 0
lastName = "Olatunji"
LastName = "Michael"
# TODO - display each of the values

# Varible naming convention - 
# - Camel casing: firstName
# - Snake casing: first_name
# - pascal case: FirstName

# Practice: Using snake_case convention, Declare menaingful variables to store the following
# - the name of customer
# - the name of customer
# - the address of customer
# - the occupation of customer
# - the date of birth of customer
# - the customer's current balance
# - the customer's telephone number
